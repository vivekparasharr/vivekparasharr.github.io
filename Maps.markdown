Following are some of the maps that I created as part of the 30DayMapChallenge!

#### #30DayMapChallenge - Day 1 - Points. 
India has ~40 cities with more than a million people, ~400 cities with between 100,000 and 1 million people, and ~2500 cities with between 10,000 and 100,000 people.
Created with Python/matplotlib.

#### #30DayMapChallenge - Day 2 - Lines
Seven major rivers and their numerous tributaries make up the river system in India. Ganga is the largest river in India. Over 5,000 Himalayan glaciers feed these rivers.
Created #python + #matplotlib

#### #30DayMapChallenge - Day 3 - Polygons
Great Lakes are a chain of deep freshwater lakes in North America. They rank among the 14 largest lakes in the world. The #GreatLakesInitiative strives to protect aquatic life, wildlife, and human health.
Created with #Python + #MatPlotLib

#### #30DayMapChallenge - Day 4 - Hexagons
Recycled my map from day 1. Used H3 library to layer in a hexagon grid and convert point lat/lng to H3 grid id for the point at level 3 (grid size of approximately 100km). 
Created using #Python + #MatPlotLib + #UberH3

#### #30DayMapChallenge - Day 5 - Something Blue
About 71% of the Earth's surface is covered with water (oceans: 96.5%, fresh water: 3%, drinkable water: 0.5%). That’s why it’s so important to #conservewater. 
Created using #Python + #MatPlotLib

#### #30DayMapChallenge - Day 6 - Red
World’s 75% active volcanoes are around the ring of fire, a horseshoe-shaped zone that stretches from the southern tip of S.America across the W.Coast of N.America, through the Bering Sea to Japan, and on to NZ.
Created using #Python+#MatPlotLib
