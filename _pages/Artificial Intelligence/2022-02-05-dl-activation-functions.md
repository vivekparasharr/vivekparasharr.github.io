## What are Activation functions?
Activation functions are a key component of neural networks in deep learning. They are mathematical functions applied to the output of a neural network layer to determine whether or not a neuron should be activated (i.e., "fired"). This output is then passed to the next layer of the neural network for further processing. There are many different activation functions that can be used in deep learning, including sigmoid, ReLU, and tanh. The choice of activation function can have a significant impact on the performance of a neural network, so it is an important consideration when designing and training a deep learning model.

## Sigmoid activation function
The sigmoid activation function is one of the most commonly used activation functions in deep learning. It is a mathematical function that maps any input value to a value between 0 and 1. The function is named after its S-shaped curve, which resembles the letter “S”. The sigmoid function is often used in binary classification problems, where the output is either 0 or 1. It is also used as a base for other more complex activation functions, such as the hyperbolic tangent and the softmax function.

The formula for the sigmoid activation function is:

f(x) = 1 / (1 + e^-x)

where x is the input to the function, and e is the mathematical constant 2.71828. The output of the sigmoid function ranges between 0 and 1. When x is negative, the output of the function is close to 0, and when x is positive, the output is close to 1. When x is 0, the output of the function is 0.5.

The sigmoid function is popular in neural networks because it is differentiable, meaning that it can be used in backpropagation to calculate the gradient of the loss function. This is important because deep learning algorithms use gradient descent to optimize the weights of the neural network. The sigmoid function is also a smooth function, which helps in the convergence of the optimization algorithm.

However, the sigmoid function has some limitations. One of the main limitations is that it is prone to the vanishing gradient problem. When the input to the sigmoid function is too large or too small, the gradient of the function approaches zero. This can make it difficult for the algorithm to learn from the data. Another limitation of the sigmoid function is that it is not zero-centered, which can make it difficult to optimize the weights of the neural network.

To overcome these limitations, other activation functions have been developed. One such function is the Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU) function, which is now the most widely used activation function in deep learning. The ReLU function is zero-centered and does not suffer from the vanishing gradient problem.

In conclusion, the sigmoid activation function is an important component of deep learning. It is useful in binary classification problems and can serve as a base for other more complex activation functions. However, it has some limitations, which have led to the development of other activation functions. When choosing an activation function, it is important to consider the specific requirements of the problem and the strengths and limitations of the different activation functions.

## Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU) activation function
Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU) is a popular activation function used in deep learning, especially for image classification tasks. It is a piecewise linear function that maps any negative input value to zero, and it is defined as f(x) = max(0, x).

The ReLU activation function has become one of the most popular activation functions in deep learning due to its computational efficiency and the fact that it helps to mitigate the vanishing gradient problem that can arise in deep neural networks.

The ReLU function is simple, non-linear, and can be computed very efficiently, making it a great choice for large datasets with a lot of inputs. It is also effective in preventing overfitting in deep neural networks.

One of the biggest advantages of ReLU is that it is very computationally efficient compared to other activation functions. This is because the function is simple to compute and requires only a single mathematical operation.

The ReLU activation function also helps to mitigate the vanishing gradient problem, which can occur in deep neural networks. When the gradient of the activation function becomes very small, the weights in the network are not updated properly, which can lead to a decline in the performance of the network. ReLU helps to prevent this problem by keeping the gradients from becoming too small.

There are some potential issues with using the ReLU activation function, however. One of the main issues is that ReLU neurons can "die" during training, meaning that they become permanently inactive and stop contributing to the network's output. This can happen if the neuron's weights become too large, causing the neuron to always output zero. This can be addressed through careful initialization of the network's weights.

Another issue with ReLU is that it is not centered around zero, which can make it difficult to optimize certain types of networks. This has led to the development of several variations of the ReLU function, including the leaky ReLU and the parametric ReLU, which are designed to address these issues.

In conclusion, the ReLU activation function is a powerful and computationally efficient choice for deep learning tasks, especially for image classification. It is effective at mitigating the vanishing gradient problem, which can be a major challenge in deep neural networks. While there are some potential issues with using ReLU, these can be addressed through careful initialization of weights and the use of variations of the function. Overall, ReLU is an excellent choice for deep learning tasks, and it is likely to continue to be a popular activation function in the years to come.

## Tanh activation function
The tanh activation function is a popular choice in deep learning, and is used in many different types of neural networks. Tanh stands for hyperbolic tangent, and is a type of activation function that transforms the input of a neuron into an output between -1 and 1. This makes it a useful choice for many different types of neural networks, including those used in image recognition, natural language processing, and more.

The tanh activation function is a smooth, continuous function that is shaped like a sigmoid curve. It is symmetric around the origin, with values ranging from -1 to 1. When the input to a neuron is close to zero, the output of the tanh function is also close to zero. As the input becomes more positive or negative, the output of the function increases or decreases, respectively, until it reaches its maximum value of 1 or -1.

One of the main benefits of the tanh activation function is that it is differentiable, which means it can be used in backpropagation algorithms to update the weights and biases of a neural network during training. This allows the network to learn from data and improve its performance over time.

Another benefit of the tanh activation function is that it is centered around zero, which can help prevent vanishing gradients and improve the convergence of the neural network during training. This is because the output of the function is always positive or negative, which helps to maintain the magnitude of the gradients.

However, one drawback of the tanh activation function is that it is prone to saturation when the input to a neuron is large, which can cause the gradients to become very small and slow down the learning process. This is known as the "exploding gradients" problem, and can be mitigated using techniques such as weight initialization and gradient clipping.

In conclusion, the tanh activation function is a useful tool for deep learning, thanks to its smooth, differentiable nature, centered output, and ability to prevent vanishing gradients. While it is prone to saturation and the exploding gradients problem, these issues can be mitigated with proper techniques and training procedures. As with any activation function, the choice of tanh should be made based on the specific requirements of the neural network and the nature of the data being processed.
