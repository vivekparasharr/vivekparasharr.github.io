Let’s cut through the noise.
Are tariffs actually good for everyday people?
Or are they just political theater dressed up as economic strategy?
You’ve probably heard the pitch:
“Tariffs protect local businesses, bring jobs home, and reduce foreign dependence.”
Sounds great in a press conference. But what really happens when the rubber meets the road?

## You Pay More. Every. Time.
Tariffs are taxes on imported goods. Companies don’t eat those costs. They pass them on to you.
That phone? More expensive.
That fridge? More expensive.
Groceries, clothes, cars? Yes, all more expensive.
It’s a price hike, plain and simple. And it doesn’t just hit luxury buyers. It hits everyone, especially the middle class and working families.

## But Don’t Tariffs Create Jobs?
Yes. In very specific industries.
Take steel. Put tariffs on imported steel, and suddenly domestic producers look more competitive. They ramp up production, hire some workers, maybe even reopen a few plants.
But here’s the catch:
Every other business that uses steel like cars, construction, or appliances, now faces higher costs.
Those costs get passed along, leading to higher prices, reduced demand, and job losses in related industries.

## Real Talk: The ROI Is Terrible
When the U.S. imposed steel tariffs in 2018:
- About 8,700 jobs were created in the steel industry.
- The cost per job? Roughly $900,000.
- Around 400,000 workers in steel-using sectors were put at risk.
That is not a good trade-off.

## Do You Ever Win?
Maybe.
If you work in the protected industry, sure.
If the government invests the tariff revenue wisely in public services, you could benefit.
If the protected industry uses the breathing room to become globally competitive, that’s a long-term win.
But those are big “ifs.”
For the average consumer, tariffs just mean you’re paying more so someone else can stay afloat.

## So Why Use Them?
One word: Politics.
Tariffs are an easy PR win.
“We’re putting our country first.”
“We’re standing up to foreign competitors.”
It sounds good on TV.
Most people don’t connect the dots between a tariff and the higher price they pay at the store six months later.

## The Real Fix
If the goal is to boost jobs and competitiveness, there are better ways to get there.
We can invest in:
- Skills training and workforce development.
- Innovation and research.
- Stronger, more resilient supply chains.
- Smarter trade deals focused on long-term growth.
These options take time and effort. But they actually work.

## Bottom Line
Tariffs sound patriotic. But they are mostly economic duct tape.
They save a few jobs by taxing millions of consumers.
If you’re not in the protected industry, you’re not winning.
You’re just paying more for less.
