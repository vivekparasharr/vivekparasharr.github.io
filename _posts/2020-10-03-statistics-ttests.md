T-tests are a class of statistical tests used to determine whether there is a significant difference between the means of two groups of data. T-tests are often used to compare the means of a sample to the population mean, or to compare the means of two independent samples or two paired samples.

Following are the most common types of t-tests are the one-sample t-test that we will cover:
- One-sample t-test: This test is used to compare the mean of a single sample to a known or hypothesized population mean.
- Independent samples t-test: This test is used to compare the means of two independent groups.
- Paired samples t-test: This test is used to compare the means of two dependent (paired) groups.


#### T-tests have several assumptions that need to be met in order for the test to be valid. The most important assumptions are:
- Normality: The data should follow a normal distribution. This means that the sample means should be normally distributed.
- Independence: The samples should be independent of each other. This means that the observations in one sample should not be related to the observations in the other sample.
- Homogeneity of variances: The variances of the two samples should be approximately equal. This means that the spread of the data should be similar in both groups.

If these assumptions are not met, the results of the t-test may be invalid or misleading. There are also different types of t-tests that make different assumptions. For example, the paired samples t-test assumes that the differences between paired observations are normally distributed, while the independent samples t-test assumes that the two samples have equal variances. It's important to carefully consider the assumptions of the test and to use caution when interpreting the results.


#### How to perform T-tests in Python
##### One-sample t-test 
A one-sample t-test is used to compare the mean of a single sample to a known or hypothesized population mean. This test is useful for determining whether a sample differs significantly from the population mean.

To perform a one-sample t-test in Python, you can use the scipy.stats.ttest_1samp function. Here's an example:

```python
import numpy as np
from scipy.stats import ttest_1samp

# Generate a sample of data
data = np.random.normal(loc=10, scale=2, size=100)

# Set the hypothesized population mean
pop_mean = 9

# Perform the one-sample t-test
t_stat, p_val = ttest_1samp(data, pop_mean)

# Print the results
print("t-statistic: {:.3f}".format(t_stat))
print("p-value: {:.3f}".format(p_val))
```

In this example, we first generate a sample of data using the numpy.random.normal function, which generates a sample of data from a normal distribution with the specified mean (loc) and standard deviation (scale). We then set the hypothesized population mean to 9.

We then perform the one-sample t-test using the ttest_1samp function, which takes two arguments: the sample data and the hypothesized population mean. The function returns two values: the t-statistic and the p-value.

Finally, we print the results using the print function, formatting the t-statistic and p-value to three decimal places.

If the p-value is less than the significance level (usually 0.05), we can reject the null hypothesis and conclude that the sample mean differs significantly from the population mean. Otherwise, we fail to reject the null hypothesis and conclude that there is not enough evidence to suggest a significant difference between the sample mean and the population mean.

##### Independent samples t-test 
An independent samples t-test is used to compare the means of two independent groups to determine if they are significantly different. This test is used when the two groups being compared are completely independent of each other.

To perform an independent samples t-test in Python, we can use the scipy.stats.ttest_ind function from the SciPy library. Here's an example:

```python
import numpy as np
from scipy.stats import ttest_ind

# Generate two independent samples of data
sample1 = np.random.normal(loc=10, scale=2, size=100)
sample2 = np.random.normal(loc=12, scale=2, size=100)

# Perform the independent samples t-test
t_stat, p_val = ttest_ind(sample1, sample2)

# Print the results
print("t-statistic: {:.3f}".format(t_stat))
print("p-value: {:.3f}".format(p_val))
```

In this example, we first generate two independent samples of data using the numpy.random.normal function. We then perform the independent samples t-test using the ttest_ind function, which takes two arguments: the two samples being compared. The function returns two values: the t-statistic and the p-value.

Finally, we print the results using the print function, formatting the t-statistic and p-value to three decimal places.

If the p-value is less than the significance level (usually 0.05), we can reject the null hypothesis and conclude that the means of the two groups are significantly different. Otherwise, we fail to reject the null hypothesis and conclude that there is not enough evidence to suggest a significant difference between the means of the two groups.

##### Paired samples t-test
A paired samples t-test is a statistical test used to determine whether there is a statistically significant difference between the means of two related groups. In other words, it helps us determine whether the two groups are significantly different from each other or not.

To perform a paired samples t-test in Python, we can use the scipy.stats module, which contains a variety of statistical functions including the ttest_rel() function. This function computes the t-test for two related samples of scores.

Here is an example code snippet for performing a paired samples t-test in Python:

```python
import numpy as np
from scipy.stats import ttest_rel

# Create two related random samples of data
before = np.random.normal(5, 1, 100)
after = before + np.random.normal(1, 0.5, 100)

# Compute the t-test
t_stat, p_val = ttest_rel(before, after)

# Print the results
print("t-statistic: {}".format(t_stat))
print("p-value: {}".format(p_val))
```

In this example, we first create two related random samples of data using the numpy.random.normal() function. We create the second sample by adding some random noise to the first sample. We then compute the paired samples t-test for these two samples using the ttest_rel() function. The function returns two values: the t-statistic and the p-value.

Finally, we print the results of the test using the print() function. If the p-value is less than the significance level (usually 0.05), we can reject the null hypothesis and conclude that the means of the two related groups are significantly different. Otherwise, we fail to reject the null hypothesis and conclude that there is not enough evidence to suggest a significant difference between the means of the two related groups.

It's important to note that a paired samples t-test assumes that the differences between the pairs of observations are normally distributed. If this assumption is not met, other tests or transformations may be needed. Additionally, like any statistical test, it's important to carefully consider the context and limitations of the test and to avoid drawing causal conclusions from statistical associations alone.



To close, T-tests are useful because they provide a simple and easy-to-interpret method for comparing two groups of data. They are widely used in a variety of fields including psychology, medicine, education, and more. However, it's important to note that t-tests have certain assumptions, such as normality of the data and equal variances, which need to be met for the test to be valid. It's also important to use caution when interpreting t-test results and to consider the context and limitations of the test.
