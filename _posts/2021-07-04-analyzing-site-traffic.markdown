Over the last couple of weeks I took a few courses on Google Analytics and AWS. This led me to thinking that maybe I can install Google Analytics property on my blog and see if I can pull any useful data from there. Also wanted to check if the data can be analyzed using an EC2 instance on AWS instead of my local computer. 

Enabling Google Analytics on your website is quite a straightforward process.

'''python
conda create –n geopandas_env  Use below command to create a new environment
conda activate geopandas_env  Activate this environment
conda config — env — add channels conda-forge  # Add conda-forge channel to your environment
conda config — env — set channel_priority strict  # Make conda-forge your first priority to install any package so that dependent package won’t conflict
conda install python=3 geopandas  # Install GeoPandas using conda
'''
