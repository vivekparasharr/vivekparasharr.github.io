Since October 2020, I have been participating in TidyTuesday, a weekly social data project hosted by R for Data Science Online Learning Community. This enabled to me to quickly up-skill the visualization aspect of my data science journey. I also had the pleasure to engage with several likeminded people and curate and learn from their submissions and thought process.
