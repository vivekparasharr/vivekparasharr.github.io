Azure is a cloud computing platform and set of services offered by Microsoft. It provides a wide range of services such as virtual machines, databases, storage, and networking, among others, that users can access and use to build, deploy, and manage their applications and services. Azure also offers a variety of tools and services to help users with tasks such as data analytics, artificial intelligence, and machine learning. Azure provides a pay-as-you-go pricing model, allowing users to only pay for the services they use.

Some of the most common Azure services include:
- Azure Virtual Machines: a cloud computing service that allows users to create and manage virtual machines in the cloud.
- Azure App Service: a platform as a service (PaaS) offering that allows developers to build, deploy, and scale web and mobile apps.
- Azure Functions: a serverless computing service that allows developers to run small pieces of code (functions) in the cloud.
- Azure Blob Storage: a cloud storage service that allows users to store and access large amounts of unstructured data.
- Azure SQL Database: a fully managed relational database service that allows users to build, deploy, and manage applications with a variety of languages and frameworks.
- Azure Active Directory: a cloud-based identity and access management service that provides secure access and single sign-on to various cloud applications.
- Azure Cosmos DB: a globally distributed, multi-model database service that allows users to manage and store large volumes of data with low latency and high availability.
- Azure Machine Learning: a cloud-based machine learning service that allows users to build, train, and deploy machine learning models at scale.
- Azure DevOps: a set of services that provides development teams with everything they need to plan, build, test, and deploy applications.
- Azure Kubernetes Service: a fully managed Kubernetes container orchestration service that allows users to deploy and manage containerized applications at scale.

There are several options to access Azure services:
- Azure Portal: The Azure Portal is a web-based user interface that provides access to Azure services. Users can log in and manage their resources in the Azure Portal.
- Azure CLI: The Azure Command-Line Interface (CLI) is a cross-platform command-line tool that allows you to manage Azure resources.
- Azure PowerShell: Azure PowerShell is a command-line tool that allows users to manage Azure resources using Windows PowerShell.
- Azure SDKs: Azure provides Software Development Kits (SDKs) for various programming languages, such as .NET, Java, Python, Ruby, and Node.js. These SDKs provide libraries and tools for interacting with Azure services.
- REST APIs: Azure services can be accessed using REST APIs. Developers can use any programming language that supports HTTP/HTTPS to interact with Azure services.
- Azure Functions: Azure Functions is a serverless compute service that allows you to run code on demand. You can use Azure Functions to access Azure services.
- Azure Logic Apps: Azure Logic Apps is a cloud-based service that allows you to create workflows that integrate with various Azure services.
- Azure DevOps: Azure DevOps is a set of development tools that includes features such as source control, continuous integration, and continuous delivery. Developers can use Azure DevOps to manage and deploy their applications to Azure services.

#### Let us explore these services one-by-one:
##### Azure Virtual Machines
Azure Virtual Machines (VMs) are a key component of many cloud-based solutions. Azure CLI provides a powerful command-line interface for managing and interacting with Azure resources, including Azure Virtual Machines. Here are some common operations that can be performed using Azure CLI on Azure Virtual Machines:

```bash
# Create a Virtual Machine: requires resource group name, virtual machine name, and operating system image.
az vm create

# Start/Stop a Virtual Machine: require the resource group name and virtual machine name
az vm start 
az vm stop

# List Virtual Machines: provides information such as the name, resource group, location, and status of each Virtual Machine
az vm list

# Connect to a Virtual Machine: requires the resource group name and virtual machine name, and it will open an SSH connection to the specified VM
az vm ssh command

# Resize a Virtual Machine: requires the resource group name, virtual machine name, and the new size of the Virtual Machine
az vm resize

# Delete a Virtual Machine: requires the resource group name and virtual machine name, and it will delete the specified VM
az vm delete

# View Virtual Machine properties: requires the resource group name and virtual machine name, and it will provide detailed information about the specified VM
az vm show
```
